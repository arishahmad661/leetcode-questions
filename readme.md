# LeetCode C++ Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various **LeetCode** problems, all written in **C++**.  
I solve problems directly in **VS Code** and commit only the `.cpp` files (compiled binaries and other files are ignored using `.gitignore`).

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each file is named according to the problem title or number from LeetCode, for example:
1_two_sum.cpp, and 2_add_two_mumbers.cpp.
